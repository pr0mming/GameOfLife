# Game Of Life
I always aroused curiosity those figures formed from a few rules
in the game of the life of Conway ... It was enough to want to program
in Java and want to implement JavaFX

# How to play?
Start with a pattern, which you want, when you are ready start
the game with "Start Game"

# Requirements
I recommend you use the latest version of <a href = "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java</a>
